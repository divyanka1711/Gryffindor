Background,3,file03.pdf,H2
"First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"has  acted  as  a  catalyst,  bringing  together  the  stakeholders  needed  to  create  the  Ontario",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario’s 5000+ public libraries, university,",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries.",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"seamless  access  to  quality  electronic  library  services.  Through  the  ODL,  students  will  be",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"able  to explore  a topic  at  school,  use  the  same child-safe resources  after school  (either  at",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"home  or  at  a  public  library),  enter  college  or  university  with  a  knowledge  of  how  to  use",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
skills and resources at work or at home.,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"all  Ontarians  with  a  stable,  high-speed  communications  infrastructure. While  there  is  still  a",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society.,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"The concept of an ODL is a key element in The Roadmap to Prosperity, a strategic plan to",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
envision and attain Ontario’s economic goal prepared by the Ontario Jobs and Investment,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to “connect students to new,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"workplaces, new sources of information and applied learning opportunities”. The ODL will do",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"that and much more.  The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"they make decisions, solve problems and enhance their quality of life.",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
"delivery point to move closer to citizens, into the smallest of libraries and even into living",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
rooms.,3,file03.pdf,H3
"Libraries have a long tradition of using a practical, consultative approach to solving problems,",3,file03.pdf,OTHER
and of learning from others.  The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems.,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is,3,file03.pdf,OTHER
leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative,3,file03.pdf,OTHER

"public, post-secondary, special, government and regional libraries.  Unlike ODL, TAL does",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
"not include elementary or secondary schools. However, the timeline and funding we are",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
proposing for ODL is comparable to TAL‘s experience. TAL’s business planning took several,4,file03.pdf,OTHER

"funding, spread over three years, later revised to 15 million dollars over 4 years. Not only is",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
"Alberta’s population 30% of Ontario’s, TAL does not include elementary or secondary",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
schools as partners; it has 250 member libraries. ODL envisions universal access for all,4,file03.pdf,OTHER
"10,000,000 Ontarians, with more than 5000 Ontario libraries as partners.  Although ODL can",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
"learn from TAL’s practices, the scope of planning and implementing ODL is much larger than",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
TAL.,4,file03.pdf,H3
The ODL will be a partnership-based organization providing seamless electronic information,4,file03.pdf,OTHER
services and resources to the citizens of Ontario. It will use local libraries as the entry point for,4,file03.pdf,OTHER
common resources  The ODL will recognize the unique responsibilities and needs of public,4,file03.pdf,OTHER
"libraries,  school  libraries,  college  and  university  libraries  and  special  libraries.  The  ODL",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
"envisions a digital network of information resources, allowing members to collaborate when",4,file03.pdf,OTHER
